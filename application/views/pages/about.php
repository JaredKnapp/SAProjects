    ETD Solution Architects (SA's) are industry recognized experts who architect solutions that incorporate selected Independent Software Vendor (ISV)
    products and ETD technologies, generating evidence of compatibility between the products. SA's create reference architectures, solution guides,
    sizing guides, TDM decks, performance data, and much more. They are the go-to team for technical proof. Documentation of SA work can be found in
    the "ISV Validation Registry" under Essential Links, below (for all ISV's across all market segments) or by clicking on one of the market segment
    icons.
